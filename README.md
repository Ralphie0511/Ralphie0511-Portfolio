# Ralphie0511-Portfolio
Hello to anyone reading! ðŸ‘‹

This is my official GitHub portfolio. I plan on using this to describe my skills, introduce who I am to people who may be interacting with me for the first time, and showcase projects I complete!

## About Me
I am a 17-year-old who fell in love with technology when I was nine. I discovered Roblox Studio on the rainy morning of New Years Eve going into 2018, and the rest is history. My love for game development and programming only grew as time went on, leading me to check out and explore various technologies and coding languages. Ever since, I've spent a good amount of time on productivity, which also includes sharpening my skills and taking online courses, along with building projects.

My journey has been powered by curiosity and a desire to create. By God's grace, I strive to improve constantly and bring my ideas to life. I love reading, learning, listening to music, playing video games and being with loved ones.

Although I am not too active on this platform, I plan on completing this GitHub portfolio and listing more of my skills in the near future.
