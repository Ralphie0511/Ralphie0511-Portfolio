# Projects
This folder links to some of the projects that I have completed and/or am actively working on.
## Roblox Games
* [Pan Smashing Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/5952217209/Pan-Smashing-Simulator)
  * Created and released in November 2020, Pan Smashing Simulator is a Roblox clicker-simulator-style game where players equip their frying pans
    and use them to earn Smashes, which they can then sell for Coins. These coins can then be used to purchase better pans and pets
    which help you to progress faster, along with different areas to explore. Additionally, players also have the option of "rebirthing,"
    which resets their progress but allows them to progress faster in the game. With their friends, players can eventually grind to become #1 on the global leaderboards!
  * The game saw immense success and is by far one of my most successful projects to-date. Updates are planned to celebrate the game's five year anniversary.
* [Pan Mayhem](https://www.roblox.com/games/14424333843/Pan-Mayhem)
  * Created in August 2023 and released in February 2024, Pan Mayhem was originally intended to be a spin-off game to Pan Smashing Simulator.
    The game was meant to expand on Pan Simulator's existing PvP mechanic, but eventually became its own separate game. In Pan Mayhem, players
    can 1v1 each other with frying pans in a match composed of 3 rounds, with each match lasting no more than 5 minutes. The winner receives Coins,
    and the game still has content planned for the future.
* [Steal a Wallet](https://www.roblox.com/games/79493562651608/Steal-A-Wallet)
  * On July 17, 2025, I lived through a real-life nightmare when I lost my wallet for the first time. As I am 17, I was devastated, and while I didn't suffer
    major losses (my age spared me from carrying credit/debit cards) I was still annoyed as I had lost some physical cash and my Driver's License, which
    I had to sort out with the DMV. Fueled with rage over the fact that it had likely been stolen (it still has not been found nearly a month later) I
    created a Roblox game in only 10 days similar to the other "Steal A" games that are currently trending on the platform. The game exceeded all expectations,
    and development is actively ongoing as the game reached over 800 monthly active users less than a month after releasing on July 31st, 2025, two weeks
    to the day my wallet was lost.
